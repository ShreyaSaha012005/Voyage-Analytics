# 🚀 Voyage Analytics: Revenue Prediction & MLOps in Travel Industry

## 📌 Project Overview

Voyage Analytics is an end-to-end data science and machine learning
project focused on analyzing customer travel behavior and predicting
total revenue in the travel domain. The project integrates EDA,
statistical hypothesis testing, ML modeling, hyperparameter
optimization, and explainability.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

To build a unified, data-driven system that understands customer
behavior and accurately predicts customer-level revenue to support
pricing, marketing, and personalization strategies.

## 📊 Datasets

-   Flights: Booking details, prices, trip duration\
-   Hotels: Stay duration, pricing, ratings\
-   Users: Demographics and membership details

## 🔍 Methodology

-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA, Correlation)
-   Feature Engineering
-   ML Models:
    -   Linear Regression
    -   Random Forest (RandomSearchCV)
    -   XGBoost (Bayesian Optimization -- Final Model)
-   Model Evaluation: R², RMSE, MAE
-   Model Explainability: SHAP

## 🏆 Final Model

XGBoost Regressor with Bayesian Optimization was selected for its
superior accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture non-linear
relationships.

## 📈 Business Impact

-   Accurate revenue forecasting
-   Dynamic pricing & personalized offers
-   Identification of key revenue drivers
-   Reduced risk from poor predictions
