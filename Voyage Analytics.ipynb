A centralized analytics layer is built to support business use cases like customer revenue analysis, top-performing brands, and high-value orders.\n","\n","On top of this data foundation, machine learning models are developed to support travel-specific use cases such as demand forecasting, dynamic pricing, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems.
